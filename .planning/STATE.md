# Project State: Project 3

## Current Phase: Phase 3 (Problem 4)
- [x] Phase 1: Problem 2 (Average TF) - Complete (Modular, Cleaned)
- [x] Phase 2: Problem 3 (Median TF) - Complete (Modular, Cleaned)
- [ ] Phase 3: Problem 4 (K-means Clustering) - PENDING (Reverted to starter state)

## Last Actions
- Cleaned up redundant comments in Problems 2 and 3.
- Reverted all Phase 3 implementation changes (K-means).
- Synchronized all source files with high-signal multi-line commenting.

## Next Steps
1. Wait for user signal to begin Phase 3.
2. Discuss Phase 3 implementation plan.
