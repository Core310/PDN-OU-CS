- [ ] Implement `process_tetranucs` (Sliding Window)
- [ ] Problem 2 Implementations (Critical, Atomic, Locks, Schedule)

## Last Actions
- Reset codebase to starter state.
- Reset planning state to Phase 1.

## Next Steps
1. Implement the sliding window logic in the Problem 2 starter code.
2. Create and compile the four mutual exclusion and scheduling variants.
